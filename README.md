### "Gyt sum werk dun"

A personal PC/Mac/Chrome assistant/advisor which gives you helpful advice on life every **whopping** 3 seconds. It is even more helpful than the world-famous Microsoft Bob, Clippy, or the Microsoft Office Assistant.

Inspired by the lovely, inspirational quotes by our fellow colleague Sir Dr Andrew Mui, PhD, ScD, BBA, MD, OMG, OCD, HIV; Captain of Scrub Airlines' Flight 370, which goes from Yeya International Yeyairport to Shizlord International Airport in Nottabarn City, Muiahland, where dreams come true thanks to the "Stop fapping around" and "Get sum werk dun" philosophy of the Nation (with of course, our dear Andrew Mui leading the way). The citizens there ask themselves "How will this help your future career?", futher gripping on their path to success.
